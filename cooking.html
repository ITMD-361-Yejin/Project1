  <h2>Potato Salad</h2>

      <p>This saland is easiest salad to make. You can pick pretty potatoes and boil them. While boiling them, you can prepare spring onion chopped. Then you can peel the potatoes and put the spring onions on them. I know you already have peppers, salt and olive oil at your home, so you can just add on it as much as you want!</p>
  <h2>Cucumber Marinade</h2>
