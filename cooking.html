  <h1>Cooking</h1>
  <p> Hi, you can see simple and delicious food, which is my favorites!</p>
  <h2>Potato Salad</h2>
      <img alt src="IMG_4523.jpeg" width="300">
      <p>This salad is the easiest one to make. You can pick pretty potatoes and boil them. While boiling them, you can chop spring onions. Peel the boiled potatoes and put the spring onions on them. I know you already have black peppers, salt and olive oil at your home, so you can just add on it as much as you want!</p>
  <h2>Cucumber Marinade</h2>

      <p>This tastes really good especially with a sandwich or a pasta! I add a video, and this youtuber who I am a big fan of is going to tell you how to make them kindly. Check out it!
