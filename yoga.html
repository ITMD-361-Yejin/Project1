        <li><b>Om(ॐ)</b></li>
        <p>Om or aum (pronounced ah-uu-mm) is a sacred sound considered by many ancient philosophical texts to be the sound of the universe, encompassing all other sounds within it. In Sanskrit, om is called Pranava, which means to hum, and is considered an unlimited or eternal sound. Although the term is linked to Indian culture, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, om chanting is a spiritual practice that transcends culture and religion and is inclusive of all possible definitions and interpretations of God, or Brahma.
